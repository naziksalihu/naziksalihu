# Hi, I'm Nazik 👋  
### Frontend Developer (HTML • CSS • Bootstrap) | Aspiring PERN Stack Developer

I am a motivated **frontend developer** with a solid foundation in **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.  
Currently, I am **progressively learning the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js)** with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer capable of building scalable, real-world web applications.

I believe in learning by building, consistency, and creating technology-driven solutions with real business value.
